# Learning_Full-Stack
Welcome to the Learning_Full_Stack repository! This repository houses my journey to learning full-stack development alongside code snippets and projects developed. 
This learning journey is based on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online.

Here's the collection of projects made during this journey:
