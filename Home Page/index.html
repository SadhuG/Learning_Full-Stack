    <h1>Learning_Full-Stack</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the Learning_Full-Stack repository! This repository houses my journey to learning full-stack development alongside code snippets and projects developed.</p>

    <p>This learning journey is based on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> a free open-source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online. </p>
    <br>

    <p>This page is currently built on barebones html and as I go further into this journey.</p>
